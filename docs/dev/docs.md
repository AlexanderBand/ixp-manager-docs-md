#Â Documentation

From v4 onwards, we use  [Read the Docs](https://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) with [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) to build the documentation and host it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/inex/ixp-manager-docs-md).



Building Locally
----------------

If you haven't already, install MkDocs:

```
pip install mkdocs
```

The documentation can then be built locally as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/inex/ixp-manager-docs-md.git
cd ixp-manager-docs-md
mkdocs build
mkdocs serve
```
