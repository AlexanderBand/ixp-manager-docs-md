# Welcome to IXP Manager

This documentation relates to IXP Manager >= v4. For v3, please see [the older documentation here](https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/wiki).

**IXP Manager** is a full stack management system for Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) which includes
an administration and customer portal; provides end to end provisioning; and both teaches and
implements best practice.

## Commercial Support

[INEX](https://www.inex.ie/) itself has limited resources but are eager for **IXP Manager** to become the de facto management system for similar IXPs and are willing to help with installations so as to build better documentation. We will consider feature requests, especially where they benefit INEX also and would certainly love feature patches!

If you want commercial support, please contact the authors directly for a quote:

Any code developed commercially or otherwise will be released under the same license as **IXP Manager**
for the benefit of all.
