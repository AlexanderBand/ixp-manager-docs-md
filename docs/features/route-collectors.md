# Route Collectors

> **Prerequisite Reading:** Ensure you first familiarize yourself with [the generic documentation on managing and generating router configurations here](routers.md).

Route collectors are an important member setup, diagnostic and metric tool for IXPs. Route collects essentially accept all routes and advertise none. **IXP Manager** will generate route collector configuration for you. You [can see an example of this generated configuration here](https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/blob/master/data/travis-ci/known-good/ci-apiv4-rc1-lan1-ipv4.conf).

At **INEX** we use the Bird BGP daemon as our collector using the stock configuration as generated by IXP Manager. We also use this same setup for the quarantine LAN collectors. You can see [our live looking glasses here](https://www.inex.ie/ixp/lg) for more information.


## Other Information

### Quarantine

We also use a quarantine route collector when provisioning new member connections. This is a Bird BGP daemon running on a virtual machine on our quarantine LAN. For is, this quarantine LAN is:

* a separate dedicated VLAN on our peering switches;
* uses the same addressing as the production LAN;
* our quarantine route collector even has the same MAC as the production version.

When [adding routers to IXP Manager](routers.md), setting the *quarantine* flag means that the configuration will only contain interfaces that are on the quarantine VLAN.
